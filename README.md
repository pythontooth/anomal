# Anonmal - Anonymous Terminal

## How does Anonmal work?
- Disposable environment: Your real filesystem stays safe. All actions are sandboxed.
- Stacked VPNs: Not just oneâ€”chain 5, 10, or more for real privacy.
- No history: Close Anonmal and nothing is saved.

## About

## Installation
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `setup.py` to configure settings and VPNs.
4. Start with `main.py`.
